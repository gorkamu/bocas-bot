With this mode you can auto schedule multiple comments.
It has two different modes.
First of all you can put you comments in CSV format and paste it on the text area field or otherwise you can upload a CSV file and the plugin will be able to process it and delete it after that.

This CSV mode has a specific format and it is the following:

``` bash
post-id,author-name,author-email,author-web,ip-address,date,comment,comment-status,user-agent
```

Each field should be splitted by a single comma and each comment have to be in a different line.

Whether you paste the csv text in the field or upload the file, always it has to be with the specified format.

As in the other plugin's options you can add the spintax format in these fields. 

## How to develop and contrib

If you want to develop new features or if you want to contribute fixing bugs you don't need install nothing except docker compose.

This plugin comes with a docker-compose file with all the needed configuration to download a copy of Wordpress and be used it as black-boxed.

The docker-compose file will download an image from PHP (where wordpress and the plugin will be) and another image for the database with MySQL installed.

To use it just launch the following command on the root folder.

``` bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

That command will download the images, the Wordpress CMS and it will lift the containers.

Then you just go to *http://localhost:8080* and *voilÃ¡*

To add a new feature or a fixed bug you should use git and generate a branch from master branch.

When the code is done send me a +Pull Request+ so i can review it and merge your branch.
