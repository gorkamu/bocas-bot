                        <p>This plugin allows you manage your own auto scheduled fake comments.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Exists two different ways to insert your own comments.</p>
                        <p>You can schedule one single comment going to the "Add comment" page. In that page you have to fill the form and submit the data.</p>
                        <p>The content field accepts text in spintax format. For more info visit <a href="http://gorkamu.com/2018/10/como-spinear-un-texto/" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The other way to schedule the comments is making a massive load.</p>
                        <p>You are able to schedule a huge amount of comments going to the "Bulk comments" page.</p>
                        <p>In that page you have two options to schedule comments.</p>
                        <p>The first option is filling the text-area with the required info and format.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The other option is loading a csv file. This csv file will be uploaded to your hosting and processed it. When it finish it will be removed. It's very simple.</p>
                        <p>The system allows you load data with the both options. If you fill the bulk text-area and upload a csv file, the system will take this two data inputs and it will processed at the same time!</p>
                        <br>
